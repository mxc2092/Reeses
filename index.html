					<h1>Who Are We?</h1>

					<p>Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are an American candy consisting of a milk, white, or dark chocolate cup filled with peanut cream, marketed by The Hershey Company. They were created by H. B. Reese, a former dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Milton S. Hershey. Reese left his job as a shipping foreman for The Hershey Company to start his own candy business.</p>

					<p>In 1923, The H.B. Reese Candy Company was established in the basement of Reese's home in Hershey, Pennsylvania.[4] Reese had originally worked at a Hershey dairy farm, and from the start he used Hershey Chocolate in his confections. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were his most popular candy, and Reese eventually discontinued his other lines</p>
